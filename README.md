# ReadingList API

*We changed the name of this series to "Watch Us Build," so you may see an occasional reference to its former name ("Soup to Bits") in this repository.*

This is the app used in the [Watch Us Build episode](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/build-a-rails-web-api) for the [Surviving APIs with Rails](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/surviving-apis-with-rails) course.

## Install

* `bundle`
* `rake db:setup`
